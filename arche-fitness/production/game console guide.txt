By default, you are in the operating environment of the GameConsole object.

Begin your commands with a question mark '?' to automatically receive output from your response:

?6 + 8
?isEnv(self.game)
?self.blacklistedSources

You can change the operating environment by using the env variable:

self.env = self.game

This will change your environment.  However, you do not have access to the env variable after using
this command because it belongs to the GameConsole class!  If you want to use a command
like you are in the default operating environment (GameConsole), begin your commands with a 
pound sign:

#self.env = self
#self.resetEnv()
#print(self.game.app)

UPDATE: you now have access to the GameConsole class through the c variable!  This variable is available any time in the console.

You can even chain this two command symbols together, using the pound sign first like so:

#?self.env
#?self.game.app

You can use the SCRIPT running auto-command by using the dollar sign $ like so:

$listScripts
$test

(You cannot pair the $ shortcut with the other symbols!  This script will run in the operating environment it is run in)

You can make your own scripts by placing them in the scripts/ folder

Check the GameConsole class for commands!  The only limit is python!
