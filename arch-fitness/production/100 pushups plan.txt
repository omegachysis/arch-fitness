FEATURES:
 - Calendar hilighting days worked out
 - Two modes of recording: solid report (user presses a button to mark the end of a set), and continuous report (user presses a button for every pushup performs and the program tracks progress)
 - Two modes of form: (these will NOT affect the program itself!)
    - Endurance - program emphasizes importance of slow pushups and continuous reporting will require that you take a given amount of time to each pushup
    - Speed - program ignores speed (generally not a good idea, but common in fitness testing)
