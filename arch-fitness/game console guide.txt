By default, you are in the operating environment of the GameConsole object.

Begin your commands with a question mark '?' to automatically receive output from your response:

?6 + 8
?isEnv(self.game)
?self.blacklistedSources

You can change the operating environment by using the env variable:

self.env = self.game

This will change your environment.  However, you do not have access to the env variable after using
this command because it belongs to the GameConsole class!  If you want to use a command
like you are in the default operating environment (GameConsole), begin your commands with a 
pound sign:

#self.env = self
#self.resetEnv()
#print(self.game.app)

You can even chain this two command symbols together, using the pound sign first like so:

#?self.env
#?self.game.app

Check the GameConsole class for commands!  The only limit is python!
